# Geoguide
# Path Planning Bot


## Overview
This project is a path planning bot that autonomously navigates to identified points using an overhead camera, OpenCV, and deep learning for event detection. It employs A* search for path calculation and communicates with an ESP32 microcontroller via WebSockets, utilizing FreeRTOS for multitasking.

## Features
- Autonomous navigation to identified points
- Overhead camera for event detection
- OpenCV for computer vision
- Deep learning for event recognition
- A* search algorithm for path calculation
- WebSocket communication with ESP32 microcontroller
- FreeRTOS for multitasking on the microcontroller

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow (or another deep learning library)
- WebSockets
- FreeRTOS (for ESP32 microcontroller)
